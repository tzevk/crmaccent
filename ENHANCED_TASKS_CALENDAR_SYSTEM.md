## Data Structures

### Task Object
```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  title: "Task title",
  description: "Optional description",
  status: "pending|in-progress|completed|overdue",
  priority: "low|medium|high",
  dueDate: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  dueTime: "HH:MM",
  category: "personal|work|project|meeting|follow-up",
  assignedTo: "user@example.com",
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
  createdAt: "ISO timestamp",
  updatedAt: "ISO timestamp"
}
```

### Calendar Event Object
```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  title: "Event title",
  description: "Optional description",
  startDate: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  endDate: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  startTime: "HH:MM",
  endTime: "HH:MM",
  type: "meeting|call|task|deadline|appointment",
  priority: "low|medium|high",
  location: "Optional location",

Files are automatically created with proper initialization if they don't exist.
