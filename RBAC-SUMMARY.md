# RBAC Integration Summary

## Completed âœ…

### 1. Database Schema & Migration
- Created comprehensive RBAC schema with users, roles, permissions, role_permissions, and user_role_permissions tables
- Migrated existing users to new RBAC schema with hashed passwords
- Created project management tables (projects, tasks, disciplines, activities, statuses)
- Populated default roles (admin, manager, staff, user) and permissions

### 2. Authentication System
- Implemented JWT-based authentication with login/logout endpoints
- Created centralized authentication utilities (`authUtils.js`)
- Added session management with user_sessions table
- Secured all API endpoints with RBAC permission checks

### 3. API Endpoints (All RBAC-Protected)
- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/profile`
- **Projects**: `/api/projects` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Tasks**: `/api/projects/tasks` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Disciplines**: `/api/disciplines` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Users**: `/api/users` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Activities**: `/api/activities` (GET, POST)
- **Statuses**: `/api/statuses` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **RBAC Management**: `/api/rbac/roles`, `/api/rbac/permissions`

### 4. Security Features
- Permission-based access control for all operations
- JWT token validation on every protected endpoint
- Role-based permission inheritance
- User-specific permission grants/revokes
- Session management and token expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### 5. Testing & Verification
- All endpoints tested with valid JWT tokens
- Unauthorized access properly blocked
- Permission enforcement verified
- CRUD operations working with proper RBAC checks

## Current System State

### Database
- Fully migrated to RBAC schema
- 5 users with different roles (admin, manager, user)
- 19 granular permissions across 5 categories
- 6 disciplines and 4 projects for testing

### Authentication
- Login working: `admin@crmaccent.com` / `admin123`
- JWT tokens include user info and permissions
- 7-day access token expiry, 30-day refresh token

### API Status
- All endpoints properly secured
- Permission checks enforced
- Error handling implemented
- Response formats standardized

## Ready for Frontend Integration

The backend is now fully RBAC-ready and can support:
1. User login/logout flow
2. Permission-based UI rendering
3. Role-based feature access
4. Secure API calls with JWT tokens
5. Complete project management workflows

## Next Steps for Production
1. Implement frontend authentication flow
2. Add permission-based UI components
3. Implement logout and token refresh
4. Add user profile management
5. Create admin panel for RBAC management
6. Add audit logging for security events
7. Implement password reset functionality
