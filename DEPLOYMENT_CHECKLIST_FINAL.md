## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify the following:

1. **Database Connection**
   - Verify all API routes can connect to the database
   - Check for any connection errors in Vercel logs

2. **Core Functionality**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Lead management (create, read, update, delete)
